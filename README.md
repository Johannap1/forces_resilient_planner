# 1. Prerequisites

## 1.1 Simulators

we use [RotorS](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator) as our simulation environment.

## 1.2 Solver

[Forces Pro](https://www.embotech.com/products/forcespro/overview/) is applied to solve nonlinear Model Predictive Control. You should request an academic license.  on its [site](https://www.embotech.com/products/forcespro/licensing/)

## 1.3 Corridor Generator

we use [Galaxy](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Galaxy) to generate corridor directly on point clouds. The code will be release after publication. 


## 1.4 External Force Estimator

we use [VID-Fusion](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/VID-Fusion) to get external force.
